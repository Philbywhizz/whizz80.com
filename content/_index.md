# Welcome to the Whizz80 Project

The Whizz80 computer project is an open-source, home brew, retro computer based on the old 8-bit Z80 CPU by Zilog from the late 1970s. The goal is to have a working stand alone computer, both hardware and software using easily available components and materials that anyone could build.
