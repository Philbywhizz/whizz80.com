The Whizz80 computer software library is rather bare at the moment due to the system simply not existing as of yet.

While you could develop on a virtual machine or a simulator, I have not found one as of yet that is suitable for a custom hardware platform such as the Whizz80. Once the hardware is at a level where simple programs can run on it software should then become available to run on it.

So in the meantime I can outline some goals

### System Software

- A Hardware monitor
- Any Hardware specific drivers
- Hardware test routines
- Common ROM routines and tools
- WhizzOS (a custom Forth based operating system)
- Basic (port)
- CPM (port)

### Application Software

- Basic based Applications
- Forth based Applications
