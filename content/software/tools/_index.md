Here is a list of all the software tools and applications that I have used in creating the **Whizz80** computer system. I currently developing on both a Mac as well as linux (Pop OS!) to do all my development on.

##### Software Development Tools

- [zasm](http://k1.spdns.de/Develop/Projects/zasm/Distributions/) - zasm is a command-line assembler for the Zilog Z80 cpu. It is available as source, which should compile on many unix-style operating systems, and as pre-compiled binary. One of the reasons I prefer this assembler over something else (such as z80pack) is that it supports macros and other nice to have features.
- [z80pack](http://www.autometer.de/unix4fun/z80pack/) - A Z80 CPU emulator that allows you to software debug your z80 applications (and even run them) on your local desktop. Invaluable for step by step debugging. These tools I will be using a lot.
- [vscode](hhttps://code.visualstudio.com/) - My second favorite editor.

##### Electronic Schematic/PCB Tools
- [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/) - Schematic and PCB Creation.

I've since ditched [Eagle](http://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview) for Schematic and PCB Creation since I last updated this website (2022). I'm more comfortable with using Eagle to design schematics and layout however I have found that [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/) has improved a lot the past year or so, and I want to stop the 'free' version of Eagle with its current limitations.

##### Website Tools

- [Hugo](https://igohugo.io/) - Allows me to keep the docs updated via command-line using markDown. No fancy GUI here.
- [Hugo-Learn-Theme](https://learn.netlify.com/en/) - The website theme used for this website.
