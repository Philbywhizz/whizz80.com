#### Why did you choose the Z80 as the CPU instead of something else such as the 6502?

>There are many blogs out there comparing the two different CPUs. However the reason why I chose the Z80 over the 6502 was it's simplicity (my opinion) and documentation. The Z80 requires a lower number of components to get started compared to the 6502. There also seems to be a better supply of Z80 components (They still make them!) than the 6502, so Z80 components are more easier for me to obtain (Iâ€™m sure your milage might be different). Also, since this is my first major build, I wanted to keep it as simple as possible and have something up and running as early as possible.

#### Why did you called the computer the 'Whizz80'?

>My nickname is Philbywhizz, or 'Whizz' for short. So combining 'Whizz' with the 80 from the Z80 CPU I came up with name Whizz80 and it has stuck.

#### I can't find an answer from any of the above frequently asked questions?
