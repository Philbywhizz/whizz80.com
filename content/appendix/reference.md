Here are a collection of reference websites, books, other sources that I have collected while working on the **Whizz80**. Some of these references have been quite valuable (especially with some of the physical books), and some of the websites have heavily influenced the design.

#### Websites

|Website|Description|
|-------|----|
|[z80.info](http://www.z80.info)|Home of the Z80 CPU. The official support page for the z80 CPU. This is a great site to start at wanting to know everything about the z80 CPU|

#### Books

|Title|Author|Description|
|-----|------|-----------|
|[How to Program the z80](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Z80-Rodnay-Zaks/dp/0895880695/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)|Rodnay Zaks|This is probably the best book I have found on programming in z80 code. You can obtain a scanned PDF of the book from the [z80.info](http://www.z80.info/zaks.html) site. I also obtained a hardcopy of this book which has been quite helpful.|
|[Z80-Assembly Language Programming Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Z80-Assembly-Language-Programming-Manual/dp/B000K72J2K)|Zilog.Inc|This is a great reference book on the assembly language from the manufacturer themselves. I have a physical rather than an [electronic copy](http://manx-docs.org/details.php/40,10864) of this book.|
