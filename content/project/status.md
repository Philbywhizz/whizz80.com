The Whizz-80 computer project is currently under slow and steady development. What that means is that the pace of the project is quite slow as I'm building this in my spare time.

A few of the hardware modules have already been designed and a few of them even built but as of yet I don't have any documentation. No software has been written yet, except for a 'hello world' to test the EEPROM loading. Writing documentation is hard :)
